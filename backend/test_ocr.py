# test_ocr.py
# A unittest-based test suite for services.pdf_service and services.ocr_service.
# - Ensures required test PDFs are generated before running.
# - Runs multiple test cases with known, expected outcomes.
# - Asserts that the extracted fields match the expected values.
# - Provides clear pass/fail results.

import os
import unittest
# IMPROVEMENT: Use the generator to ensure test files are always available.
from sample_generator import generate_seed_files
from services import pdf_service, ocr_service

# --- Test Configuration ---
# IMPROVEMENT: Define structured test cases with file paths and expected results.
# This makes it easy to add more tests in the future.
